<h2 style="position: relative; left: 266px; width: 800px;">One way us humans can help is by picking up trash in the water and all things that relate to pollution, thatâ€™s one way us humans can help another way to help is by using less fertilizer as if we were to use too much of it the excess fertilizer would pollute the water by causing toxic algal blooms which can be harmful to all of the aquatic life in the ecosystem so using less fertilizer would cut of the excess amount that runs down into the water meaning the water will no be as affected. Anouther solutions is that we can start funding and creating more Robots to collect trash. Numerous of Companys have created machines or robots to pick up trash. How to robots work is actually very interesting. They build a long rod on the robot which catches the trash and then they move the trash towards the robot and at the robot they put the trash in a trash bag and stores it in the storing container. In which after the day (or if the storage container is full) the robot will come back to land and dump the trash to one of their facilities. That is how one of the many different robots operate. If your not a multimillion dollar corporation then you can also support by donating to Team Seas Which is an organization that for every single dollar they will remove one pound of trash.<a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/teamseas-signup" target="_blank">Team Seas.</a> If you want to help with the trash eating robots then if you donate to use we will make 100 robots if we reach our goal of 100k<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h2>
